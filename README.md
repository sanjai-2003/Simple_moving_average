# Simple_moving_average
The language used for calculation of Simple moving average is Python. Before running the program make sure Python and Pandas are installed, if not 
use the command: pip install requirement.txt 

Use the following command to run the program from Simple moving average folder: python3 SMA.py 

After running the program you can see the RELIANCE.csv updated. After update it consists of all the missing SMA values. 
 
Along with this, I have attached the OUTPUT.csv which is the output I got.
