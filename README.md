# Simple_moving_average
The language used for calculation of Simple moving average is Python. Before running the program make sure Python and Pandas are installed.

Use the following command to run the program from Simple moving average folder::

1. pip install requirement.txt
2. python3 SMA.py

After running the program you can see the RELIANCE.csv updated. After update it consists of all the missing SMA values.

Along with this, I have attached the OUTPUT.csv which is the output I got.
